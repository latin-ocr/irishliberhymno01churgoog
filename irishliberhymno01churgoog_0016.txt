scraps 01 vellum bound in at the end, which we have numbered
as fragmento i, ii, 7 iii. The first page which probably con·
tained the Preiace to S. Sechnall’s hymn Audite ornus, in
honour 01 S. Patrick‚ is missing, 22 12 2120 one solio between

· 1122 and 13, and two iolios between ff. 24and 25 (see p149).

The iolios towards the end have been displaced by the binder‚
and'their order should be: 23, 29, 30, 32, 32, 34, 26, 27, 33, 28.
We have printed the text in this order. lt is not possible
now to determine in what sashion the leaves were gathered and
bound together¹ when the MS. was in its original 102222. 12

ι’ contains the pie'ces 1-40 (incl.) in order as given'in the Τ able os

contente The initial letters os the hymus are beautiful specimens
oi the lrish 'art 01 illumination in the middle ages; and the ¹

writing as 122 22 iol. 31 is splendidly executed (see¹ Plate 1).
’ Α1222 this point it degenerates, and is apparently 01 considerably
later date than that 01 2122 main body oi the manuscript; itis
probable indeed that these later hymns, none 01 which occurs

· in the Franciscan copy, may not in strictness belong to the

Liber Hymnorrrm itseli'but are supplementary pieoea added
, by a latei scribe There are various styles 01 writing‘ln the
manuscript ¹'l‘he Latin hymns 22 iar as No. 25 arel in'a fine
square semi-uncial which we have represented by pica type ς the
- lrish hymns and the prayers are in an angular character, and we
have printed them in mallpr'ca, as also the Prefacea which are in ’
asmaller angular hand. Assar as No. 23 there are interlinear
and marginal glosses to all the hymns in Latin and lrish in
very minute writing which, we have given in brevr'aer type¹ ln
addition to these there are notes in the upper margins, much
delaced and very hard to read, which we have attempted to
reproduce at the end-os each hymn; they are chiefly extracts'
from Augustine, Isidore, Gregory and Hraban 01 S. Maur, and
do not seem as a rule to have any special bearing upon the
text. But it· has been necessary sor the plan oi this edition to

ιη’ ’1122 references at the 1002121 the puger in 2222222211 type bave been added
