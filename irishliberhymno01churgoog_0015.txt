in lrish MSS. We have tried to mark by differences ol type
the more conspicuous differences ln the various styles oi writing ¹ ' '
that occur in T. ’ ,

The chief delect in Dr. Todd’s presentation of the text arose ἕ
from the lack ol MS. evidence which he had before him, and he-
had recourse sometimes in consequence to the testimony' ol'
printed editions. This delect we have tried to remedy, and in
some cases have been able to add considerably to the MS. .
testimony heretolore printed; in other‘cases we have sailed to
lind our hymns existing elsewhere (eg. Nos. 25, 26, 29, 37-39‚ .
41, 45) ; but we have been carelul to base our apparatur critr’cus
in all cases on MS. evidence alone

of the hymns‚ presaces, and glosses in the lrish language,
translations are given in our second volume. These areentirely ¹

” the work ol Dr. Atlcinson, who is also solely responsiblelor the

collation of the Irish picces with the manuscripts, and lor the
Glossaries of the Irish words in *the principal hymns (Nos. 5, . Α
19-24‚ 29), and in the Amra (No. 33), which are printed at the
end ol this volume. ln these glossaries no account is taken os · ,
the vocabulary ol the Preiaces or the Glosses, as these represent ·
a later stage in the language; and l'or a like reason, the later “
lrish picces (Nos. 36-42) are not drawn upon. For the collation .
of the Latin texts ol Τ, F and B, Dr. Atlcinson and 1 are
jointly responsible; the materiale ior the rest oi the apparatur
critiam l have mysell collected. The introduction to Vol. 11,
which deals with the metrical systema ol the Liber Hymnorum,
is the worle oi Dr. Atkinson; 1 have writt'en all the notes, with ·
the exception of a lew on lrish lingulatic‚ which will be readily'

recognised.
