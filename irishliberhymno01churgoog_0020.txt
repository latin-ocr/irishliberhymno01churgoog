Α reference‘to the Preiaces to the Quintoque uult and the

Te Deum in F (see pp. 203, 59 infra) will show conclusively ' '

that F· was the MS. to which Ussher here refers. There is still
a paper MS. in Ussher's collection in the Library 01 Trinity
college (E. 3. 28), containing a copy 01 'certain 01 the Irish
hymns in F ς that 1² was its source rather than T is evident as
weil from some 01 the readings adopted as from the order in
which the hymns have been transcribed¹

1², however, must have been at the Franciscan Monastery 01
Donegal in 1630, 101 it was one 01 the books from which
Michael O’Clery tells ,111 he composcd the Martyrology os
Donegal, “begun and ended ” in that year? Shortiy afterwards
it lest [reland,· and in company with the other Donegal MSS.
reached the Franciscan house at louvain. It was probably
through Michael O’Clerys zeal that they were put in saie cus·
tody there⁸ They were studied by the great F ranciscan scholar
Father John Colgan, and the copies 01 some 01 the most famous
01 0111 hymns, printed by him in the Trr’as Tharrmaturga (1645),

'were derived from 1², as is apparent from the text which he '

gives. From thence F iound its way to S. Isidoro, Rome, ,where
it remained until the year 1872, when permission was given by

the Gendral 01 the Order 101 the return 01 the Irish manuscripts .
to Dublin; they are now housed in the Franciscan Monastery, ’

- Merchants' Quay. To the courtesy 01 the Librarian, Rev. T. A.

O'Reilly, O.S.F., we are indebted 101 access to F at all times.
