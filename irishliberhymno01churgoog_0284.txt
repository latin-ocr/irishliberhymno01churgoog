111150) 104, 1 2 11-11 mathair dr’tlr ind ldlg, which Stokes translates in Gont,
“at (its mother the eall suckled ”1 but ind larg is gen. 131,, and even
it we read with F ldcg, itis impossible to talre r'nd as a nom, and both
MSS. have ind. Ol course, it is perlectly easy to entend the text by
substituting in lor 11111, but it is not absolutely certain what the pre·
vious word dr'llr means. Colgan’s sugebat is ol just as much value as
the gl. radinestar, save that it is perhaps a little rnore definite, but it
does not follow that either authority is final in tlte case,-and there is
no other, sor the word does not occur anywhere else. The text, as it
stands, took ditlr as a noun. Now it is notewortby that LB says
nothing about sucke'ng: boi in loeg immalle ria mathair, ‘the cali was
there along with its mother’; and Cogitosus lrnows just as little as
[Β ol any “ sucking,'’ lor Colgan¹s text reads : “ut nullum... . susti·
neret damnum ipsa hospitalis, quae vitulum amiserat suae vaccae,
alterum in eadem sonna curn sua invenit vacca &c.” lt ntust ben
noun ς the cholce lies between an infin.. dltlr, τὸ sugere, and dille ind
hug, ‘tlte loss ol the call’, sor ‘tlte los1(›teitse·ntr)calg¹ quae vitulum
amiserat suae vaccae. ll this scena too ungunrnntced an interpreta-
tion, there is nothing lor it but to take dltlr=‘nct ol sucking!
l shall not labour the point, but surely ‘the call suckled 01 its mother'

is not a happy expression. lrish forms are complex enough, but dul
ind ldrg does not justily the acceptance os dille = suxit ,Ι
