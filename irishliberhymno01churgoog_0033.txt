the early use of some os the pieces in the Liber Hymnorum. '

Were these pieces only used in ocmsr'onal oflices, or did they

form part os the regular choir services? This is a question not
easy to answer with confidence. Dr. Lawlor thinks char the
Mulling office was said daily, and probably both at bed-time
(like Compline) and at early morning (like Mattius).¹ However
the context in whichit appears ³¹¹, the Visio adamnani, us it
proves that the office, at the date ol that piece, was used at -
special seasons with a special motive, suggests that it did
not sorrn part os the ordinary rule. And it seems to rne
that the laets adduced by Dr. Lawlor prove, not that the office
as a nile was in daily use, but, that several of the pieces named
in it were considered as suitable lor daily recitation. This,
indeed, is beyond question, as we shall see in the sequel. We
proceed to collect the facts which suggest that a book of hymns
like 'l‘ and F was used at the Celtic daily offices. lt will be
borne in mind that only the first twenty-six pieces in 'l' are
to be considered as belonging to the book in its original
form. , ·

directed to be sung in monastic houscs throughout
the Three-day l'estival oi St Patriclr. The ¹Irish
