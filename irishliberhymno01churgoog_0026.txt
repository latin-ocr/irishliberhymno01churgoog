Books ol hymns are not mentioned in the West before the
time oi St Hilary os Poitiers, who, according to St. Isidore oi

that a Lon Hymnorum by Hilary was extant in his day.⁸ As

Columbae· of 'which he tells a wonderful story that need' not

r'onrm sanctae Columbae manu desmptus, which apparently

means a book ol hymns ior weelrly use. According to the B

Prelace osmentrusprosaror(seev01. ii. p. 23),oneol tbe presents

sent by Pope Gregory to Columba was “The Hymn ol' the

Adamnan tells that on the morning ol S. Columb's's death

hymns were sung at the monastic offices at Iona3 mnu
