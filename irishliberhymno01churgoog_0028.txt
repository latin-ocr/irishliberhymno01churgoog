INTRODUCTION. xiiii

No. 3 stands as follows in the, manuscript: Benedictus usq,·
iola . . . , which 1 believe to have been correctly identified
by Dr. Lawlor with part of the hymn Noli pater (sec p. 88),
rather than with the familiar hymn of Zacharias, which naturally
suggests itself For this identification some reasons, in addition
to those mentioned by Dr. Lawlor‚ will be given below (ser p.
xxvi and vol'‘ u p. 172).

In trinitate spes mea (No. 8 ιιι our collection), rather than with ι

the antiphon fluitur m trinitate(p42 infra) suggested by Dr.
Lawlor.

No. 14 is quite illegible; but the collect Ascendere oratio
follows the Creed and the Lord's Prayer in a short office in the
Liber Hymnorum (p. 156, rirsra) ; and 1 believe, therefore, that it
probably occupied the same place in the Mulling Office

There was also something in the manuscript before Mag·
nr'slcat, which cannot now be read.

. In Dr. Lawlor’s opinion this directory for an office is written
by the hand of one of the scribes of the Book of Mulling3 and
it is therefore to be ascribed to the ninth century. It is
interesting to find a trace of the use of so many of the pieces in
the Liber Hymnorum at so early 2 date The Book ol Mulling,
indeed, rs thus the earliest witness to several of our hymns; for
our manuscripts (T and F) are liter by two or three centurie&

It rs important to observem the next place, that there rs
another reference rothe Mulling office in Celtic literature, a
reference which explains, as it seems to me, its occasion and
