print them so far as they are legible, in order that the reader Ι
may have the entire contents of the MS. before him. These, ’
together with the glosses, may be somewhat later thm. the

text of the hymns; but it does not seem to us that there

is any clear evidence for this, palaeographical or other. ,The

MS. is not easy to date with precision, but it is probably , -
of the eleventh century and perhaps belongs to its earlier .-
years. ,

Of its history we know practically nothing. Ithasbeenin the
Library of Trinity College since the middle of the seventeentb
century; and it is possible that itcame to us through Archbishop
Ussher, although it is not kept with the bulk of his manuscripts. ’
Α few notes from it are found in the seventeenth century paper '
MS. F.4 30, in the same Library, but they throw no light on ι

·’ its provenance .

Itis probable that Ware had seen it, though it is possible
that his words refer to another copy of the Liber Hymnmm
which we have failed to trace ln his opuscula S. Patrr'cr‘i
(p. 144) he says: “Neque hic praetermittendum extare etiam·
num Hymnum S. Patricio attributum, in antiquo tum Latinorum .
tum Hibernicorum Hymnorum codice, literis Hibemicis
descripto, ad conuentum fratrum minorum de obseruantia
Donegalliae olim pertinente, qui ita definit; Domini est salus.
domini est salus, salus tua Domine sit semper nobiscum, ⁴
Reliqua pars eiusdem lingua Hibemica conscripta est, a cuius
peritia me longe abesse profiteor; ideoque Hymni illiuseditio Α
ab alio quopiam est expectanda'¹

The piece here referred to the ‘Lon'm S. Patrr‘cti (our Nm 24)
is not in' F; andF seems to be complete and to have survi'ved -
without mutilation. Itis in Τ, but there is no other evidence
for connecting T with the Donegal Franciscans ; and further the
Latin versicles at the end do not agree exactly with the text of
them in T. They agree much better with the readings of Θ
(see p. 1 3 5) ; but then Θ = Rawl. B. 512 could not possibly be
described as a Book osLatt'n and Inrlr Hymns.
