INTRODUCYION.

remaining pieces in Τ and F, lor only a few-and those not the ·
rnost remarkable-have yet been mentioned.

The lrish hymns (Nos. 19-24) were probably sung on the ,
festivals 01 St Patrick and st Brigid. They could hardly have

, been in daily use. Perhaps, too, No. 9 belonged to the least 01
St Martin. Again‚ Nos. 4, 5, and (perhaps) 16, are suitable
rather 101 use in time 01 pestilence or sudden danger, than as
part 01 “ the regular rule (see vol. ii, p. 172). in some cases our
hymns were used privately. Nos. 1,9, 14, 17, and 24 seem to
have been said as charms‚ the recitation 01 which was efficacious
against hurt and danger (see vol. ii, p. 210). The piece in
praise ο1 hymnody (No. 41) prefixed to the F manuscript shows
how highly esteerned hymns were in this regard. Nos. 25 and
26 also seem to be better adapted 101 private penitence and
prayer than 101 the public worship 01 the community.

The conclusion is thus suggested that the Liber Hymnorum
may have served a double purpose. It contains a number 01
hymns and cantieles which are associated with the monastic
offiees 01 Western Christendom‚ and it also contains pieces
which seem suitable 101 private and occasional recitation, rather
than 101 daily use in choir.

But 1 arn not sure that the collections in their present l'orrn

. were originally made 101 the purposes ο1 the Divine Offiee at “
all. It seems not impossible that the various pieces may have ⁹

been gathered into one book at a time when the Celtic services Ι
had given place to the English use, with the pious motive 01
preserving a record 01 an older state 01 things. The copious Ι
glosses which elucidate (or obscure) the meaning 01 the phrases ’

employed indicate rather the boolr 01 an antiquary than a ser-
vice boolr 101 devotional use. Among the older Celtic monlrs
there must have been many in the eleventh a'nd tweltth cen·
turies who resented the introduction 01 a new order 01 worship,
and who would sain preserve the memories 01 their past Our'
principal manuscript (T) might well have been written with this
laudable intention. The fact that the handwriting changes
