xxii INTRODUCTION.

succeeded in deciphering at the end of S. John⁸s Gospel in
the Book of Mulling, a ninth century copy of the Latin Gospeu
preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin ‚He has
observed that in several cases the last three verses or a hymn
are prescribed for recitation, in accordance with a Celtic usage
of which we shall give instances further on (see vol. ii, p 98);
and he has thus beenenabled to identify nearly all the pie'ces
mentioned in the directory. For the details of his most
ingenious reasoning, we must refer the reader to his mono·
graph; but we give here his scheme of the service “ lt
consiste? he writes (l.c. p. 162) “of the following parts (following
an illegible portion at the beginning)·:-
1. The Song of the B.V.M. (Magnificam
2?
’ 3. Stanzas 4, 5, 6, of the Hymn of S. Columba (Noli ¹
Pater).
4 Α lection from the beginning of S. Matthew v, followed
apparently by a formula not yet identified.
5. The last three stanzas of the Hymn of S. Secundinus
(Auditcomnes).
6 and 7. Two stanzas supplementary to this hymn (Iu
memon'a and Patricius episcopus).
8. The last three stanzas of the Hymn of Cummain Fota
(Celebra Iuda). '
9. The antiphon Exaudi, dre, appended to this hymn.
ro The last three stanzas of the Hymn of S. Hilary of ,
Poictiers (Hymnum dicat).

11. The antiphon Uiritus in trinitare, &c

12. The Apostles* Creed. ,

13. The Lord’s Prayer, followed possibly by

14 The Collect Ascendat matio, &c.”

The manuscript is extremely hard to read3 but Nos 2, 3, 11,
and 14 of the above are the only items, 1 think, about which
there can beany reasonable doubt. ¹

No. 2 is quite illegible, and 1 can offer no suggestion.
