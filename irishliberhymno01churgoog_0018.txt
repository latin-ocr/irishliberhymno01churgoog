INTRODUCTION. xiii

lf Ware's evidence is to be securely relied on, his words ἢ
would suggest the existence of another copy of the 'Liber‘ =

Hymnomm, possibly at Brussels, where some of the Louvain
manuscripts ultimately found a home. But we have not been
ableto trace the⁸ existence of such a book; and perhaps th'e true‘
inference to draw from Ware’s statement is that he had seen T·
(though where, we know not) and was speaking from memory,or
from imperfect notes, of the versicles at the end of the lorica
- The reference to the Donegal Franciscans may be due· to some
further confusion with F. Itis hardly likely that the Donegal
Convent had two coplas of the Liber Hymnomm.

Α beautiful modern copy on paper of the entire volume (Τ)
was acquired by 1Trinity College in 1892, at the dispersion of the'
library of Bishop Reeves, the eminent Celtic scholar and
antiquary. Ar the end of this there is a colophon: “Ar na
crtocnuecad du Patraic h Caoim. mdcccxlii,'’ which seems to
indicate that it was the work, not of Bishop Reeves himself as ι
we were inclined to believe on a hasty examination, but of
one ramo< overe, who was iren-known in Dublin haffu
century since as an Irish scribe It is carefully executed,
and aima at reproducing its exemplar paginatam et· littratim3
but it does not add in any way to our knowledge of the ,
book . f .

· F. .This· valuable ΜΒ, now preserved in the Library of the

· Franciscan Convent at Dublin (saec xi), is the only other copy

of the Iriah Liber Hymnomm known to us It consists of 23
fullos, and it contains fn the following order the pieoes which are

numbered 41, 42, 14, ις, 16, 17, 18, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7,‘8, 9, 43, 44, 10

45. 5,64 11, 46, 12, 13, 19, 2ο, 21, 22, 23, 47, in our Table of ’ν

Contenta. It thus omits Nost 24-40 (incl.) which are found
, in T, and contains Nos 41-47 (incl.) which are absent from
that Ms.; the remaining hymns being common to both MSS.. 1
though not always occurring in the same order. Of the pieccs
peculias to F, only 41 and 42' are in Irish, the rest being
Latin. lt is not a copy of Τ, as wilibe seen from the collation,
