show that this piece also was sung by the members os
religious-houses at the early morning hours. And 'the
antiphon appended to the hymn In te Chn‘stc (p 85 '
infra) . .· . dum sr'bi ymnos canimus decim statutr‘s

(see vol. ii, p 213) to have any connexion with the ,
text os sol. 213 but its presence in T may indicate that
the book was in common use in ehoir. .

These indications are, it is true, by no means conclusive ;
but they confirm to some extent what is primd facie probable
